        <p class="container__lrtext">At school we had a workshop day where we had to focus on Lightroom and Photography.
          We had to take two pictures, one portrait and one of an item. For the item I choose fake ice cubes and spray it
          with some water. We had to light sources which we played around with, to make the perfect picture and to put the
          shadow where we wanted. I’m very satisfied with the picture.
          For the portrait picture my friend took the picture of me, I’m really happy with how it turned out and therefore used the
          picture on the frontpage of this website. </p>
          <p></p>
        <p class="container__lrtext">When we had done the pictures, we got a small introduction to Lightroom and Photoshop,
          I have used both programs before, so I knew most of what he told us, but I found it very funny. As said before I love editing. </p>
          <p></p>
        <p class="container__lrtext">I decided for the edit to give the picture of the cube a neon vibe, with red and cyan.
          I’m really into neon edits and I love how it brings live to a picture. For the portrait I put a dark filter on and just played around with the contrast. </p>
