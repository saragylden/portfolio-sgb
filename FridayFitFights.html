            <p class="container_ffftext"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/fridayfitfights/">Friday Fit Fights</a> is a fashion inspiration page on Instagram, which I made 30th of March 2020, and it has grown a lot since then. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="container_ffftext">The page is called Friday Fit Fights, because every Friday we are hosting story fit fights, where people can submit their fit pictures
              for joining, there are either 32 or 64 spots every Friday. The fights get posted on our story, where everyone who sees the stories can vote for which outfit, they
              like the most, and the winning fits get to be in a fight the next day as well, after approximately 5 days we have found 1 winner, who gets a shoutout on both our story and feed.
              Besides from doing the story fights we also daily share outfits on our feed, for a chance of getting on the page, people are tagging us in their outfits.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="container_ffftext">We are also selling different type of posts (spot in the story fight, spot on the feed or solo post) to private persons and brands as well.
              Many people and brands are interested in investing in themselves and our page is a great way to do that, as we reach out to many people interested in fashion. </p>
              <p></p>
            <p class="container_ffftext">The layout of the page is very important to me, I like to keep it simple and recognizable, which is why the story fights all have the “FFF”
              repeating up and down on the layout. Thanks to that many people are thinking of our page whenever they see FFF or the light blue color.</p>
