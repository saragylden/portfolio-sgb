          <p class="container_pptext">We got an assignment in school, where we had to film a day in our life.
            I had many ideas what to film, but I found it hard to film it. I’m not used to filming, I much
            rather wanna take pictures. I settled on filming me and my girlfriend making some Christmas food,
            so I drew a storyboard so that I had a plan on what to film and how. I tried to get some good close-up angles, but I found it difficult.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="container_pptext">When I came to the edit part, I found it much more fun. It was very fun how a few cuts could make a video look so much different,
              and also putting filters and music on. I used one of the tones PremierePro offers, because I found it very Christmas like</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="container_pptext">I would love to challenge myself by doing more videos and try and make great edits.
              I can see myself be editing videos for influencers, as short videos are starting to pop up a lot, and would
              definitely be interesting in doing that, because it would challenge me and I would be learning a lot from it, plus it’s fun.</p>
